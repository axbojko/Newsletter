Tasks such as onboarding a new device or replacing an existing device in a networking fabric should be simple and trivial, yet they remain complex in far too many organizations today. Touching the network is traditionally looked at as a necessary evil\u2014invasive and complex\u2014that introduces risk, forcing many organizations to hire expensive outside consultants to perform these tasks. </p> <p>In this article we will talk about how to safely and easily onboard and replace an Arista device using Arista CloudVision as a Service (CVaaS) Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) and Zero Touch Replacement (ZTR) Studios. No copying of configurations to text-files, USB sticks, or external consultants necessary. CloudVision Studios truly make these tasks as safe and simple as zero touch.</p> <p> Part Two - Device Replacement</p> <p>Zero Touch Replacement is a CloudVision feature that enables the network administrator to easily and safely replace network devices, such as Arista switches and routers in the network or network fabric, while maintaining all configurations and  automation relationships in CloudVision.  ZTR utilizes the ZTP process described in part one of this article. If your device supports ZTP and has been provisioned in CloudVision - it also supports ZTR.</p> <p> Process</p> <p>After the replacement device has been successfully installed, cabled and onboarded using ZTP it will appear in CloudVision Studios \u201cNetwork Updates\u201d under Inventory and Topology Studio, and in the general CloudVision Inventory, where it will remain unconfigured in ZTP mode until a designed configuration has been assigned to the device.</p> CloudVision Studios - Inventory and Topology View <p></p> <p>The full configuration, automation tags, device role etc will be delivered to the device  as a part of the ZTR process, where the replacement device will assume the identity from the device it is replacing. CloudVision will update itself accordingly with the new device\u2019s information such as serial number, device ID, etc.</p> <p>In this example we want to replace \u2018Leaf1\u2019 with the device currently known as \u2018sw-192.168.30.175\u2019, as you can see in the device inventory below.</p> <p></p> CloudVision - Device Inventory List <p>The ZTR process is initiated from Registered Devices under the  Inventory and Topology Studio. Simply select the device you want to replace, choose the replacement from the drop down menu of available unconfigured replacement devices, and begin the replacement.</p> <p></p> CloudVision Studios - Inventory and Topology Studio, Replace Device  <p>A CloudVision workspace is automatically created and the change control initiated. After a careful review you can submit the change control for validation and approval.  Additionally, replacement devices will inherit any existing image bundle assigned to the original device.  </p> <p></p> CloudVision Studios - Workspace Review  <p>In this example 149 lines of configuration are pushed to the device, 3 lines untouched, and 285 lines removed - mostly default ZTP configuration.</p> <p></p> CloudVision - Change Control  <p>After successfully completing the  change control stages, \u2018sw-192.168.30.175\u2019 is now \u2018Leaf1\u2019, it is active, alive, and streaming real-time telemetry to CVaaS. </p> <p></p> CloudVision - Updated Inventory  <p>Notice the Device ID for \u2018Leaf1\u2019 is the same as the switch formerly known as  \u2018sw-192.168.30.175\u2019. </p> <p>The ZTR process has completed, and the old device can now be decommissioned.</p> <p></p> <p>For more information and requirements on ZTR, click on the link below.</p> <ul> <li>Replacing Devices in CloudVision Studios</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!

Arista switches and routers support multiple ways of ZTP onboarding, but this article will focus on the latest version utilizing the embedded hardware enrollment token present on all Arista devices shipped after September 2020 running EOS 4.26.1 or later.  Please note \u2013 should you have devices without the embedded enrollment token, you can    create one in CVaaS, copy it to your device, and add DHCP option 67 (https://www.arista.io/ztp/bootstrap) to your DHCP server. This will allow you to follow the same onboarding process.</p> <p> Components</p> <ul> <li>Arista device with embedded enrollment token</li> <li>CloudVision as a Service</li> <li>DHCP server providing a management IP address, a gateway address, DNS and NTP services  </li> </ul> <p> Process</p> <p>All new Arista switches and routers shipped, as well as any devices without a startup config present, automatically enters ZTP mode at boot. This enables the device to obtain an IP address through any front facing or management interface and to connect and self-register to your organization's CVaaS instance. You simply connect it to the network. After receiving a DHCP address and connecting to CVaaS at www.arista.io, the automated onboarding process will begin.</p> Zero Touch Provisioning - Process Illustration <p>Your new switch or router will stay connected to CVaaS in ZTP mode until it has been onboarded and a boot-file configuration has been received. Once received the system will apply that configuration as startup-config, exit ZTP mode and restart. The system is now onboarded to studios and fully configured with the designed configuration.</p> <p></p> <p>Let\u2019s take a look</p> <p>The following console outputs are grabbed from a freshly booted CCS-710P-16P entering ZTP mode. It sends DHCP requests from all front-facing and management interfaces.  </p> <pre><code>No startup-config was found.\n\nThe device is in Zero Touch Provisioning mode and is attempting to \ndownload the startup-config from a remote system. The device will not \nbe fully functional until either a valid startup-config is downloaded \nfrom a remote system or Zero Touch Provisioning is cancelled.\n</code></pre> <p> The 710P then receives a DHCP IP address, and immediately connects to apiserver.arista.io, where it is directed to the CVaaS cluster hosting your organization</p> <pre><code>...\n%ZTP-6-INIT: No startup-config found, starting Zero Touch Provisioning\n...\n%ZTP-6-DHCPv4_QUERY: Sending DHCPv4 request with system MAC address on [ Ethernet18 ] (option 67, 143)\n%ZTP-6-DHCPv4_SUCCESS: DHCPv4 response received on Ethernet18 [ Ip Address: 192.168.10.76/24; Nameserver: 9.9.9.9; Domain: sefeld.dk; Gateway: 192.168.10.1; NTP Serve)\n%ZTP-6-CLOCK_SYNC_SUCCESS: Successfully synchronized the device clock using NTP\n%ZTP-6-CLOUDVISION_ENROLLMENT_START: Attempting enrollment into CloudVision at endpoint: apiserver.arista.io:443\n...\n%ZTP-6-CLOUDVISION_REDIRECTOR_SUCCESS: Cluster assignment from CloudVision Redirector service successful: https://www.cv-prod-us-central1-c.arista.io\n%ZTP-6-CLOUDVISION_ENROLLMENT_SUCCESS: Successfully enrolled switch into CloudVision\n...\n</code></pre> <p> After enrollment and registration in CVaaS Studios inventory it is identified by an automatically given host name (sw-192.168.10.76) based on the DHCP IP, and its serial number (WTW24520453). After assigning the designed configuration to the device, you will see it show up as out of compliance. </p> <p></p> Device Config Out of Compliance - CloudVision Example <p></p> <p>This is because CVaaS and the EOS real-time streaming telemetry daemon compares the running config on the physical device with the designed configuration, which is mismatched. We need to make a change control and sync the device with the designed config in CVaaS.</p> <p></p> Successful Change Control - CloudVision Example <p></p> <p>As shown in the above screenshot, CVaaS has added 138 lines of configuration (green), removed 263(red), mostly default ZTP configuration, and modified 2 existing lines(blue). Notice the devices name changed to the configured hostname (710P-16P) as well. </p> <p></p> <pre><code>....\n%ZTP-6-CONFIG_DOWNLOAD: Attempting to download the startup-config from https://www.cv-prod-us-central1-c.arista.io/ztp/bootstrap\n%ZTP-6-CONFIG_DOWNLOAD_SUCCESS: Successfully downloaded config script from https://www.cv-prod-us-central1-c.arista.io/ztp/bootstrap\n%ZTP-6-EXEC_SCRIPT: Executing the downloaded config script\n...\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>The above image shows that the 710P-16P has successfully received its config script and new designed configuration. It will apply the new configuration and restart. The device is back, and shows as compliant and active in CVaaS inventory</p> Device in Compliance - CloudVision Example <p>Please keep an eye out for Part Two of this article - replacing a device using the ZTP Studio in CVaaS.</p> <p></p> <p>For more information and requirements on ZTP and ZTR click on the links below.</p> <ul> <li>Devices supported with Embedded token</li> <li>ZTP using an Embedded Token</li> </ul>"},{"location":"archive/January-2026/#upcoming-events","title":"Upcoming Events","text":"<p>Arista hosts various events throughout the year for you!

The term software upgrade is synonymous with network downtime in the realm of network engineering. Schedules must be adjusted, clients and customers alerted, and downtime, or planned outages, must be scheduled to complete these tedious procedures. Even a few seconds of downtime can have a real operational and financial impact on many organizations. For certain domains, like healthcare, network downtime is unacceptable.  </p> <p>Arista aims to flip the script on software upgrades by delivering game-changing hitless upgrades that result in minimal to no packet loss and no impact to end users. Yes, you read that correctly, leveraging the power of Arista SSU (Smart System Upgrade), an EOS switch supporting Access Points, PC's, IP Phones, IP Cameras, and any other end device can undergo a software upgrade without any impact to client traffic.  </p> <p>In this article, we will highlight how the hitless upgrade procedure works, and how you can complete the upgrade solely through CloudVision.   </p> <p>SSU, or Arista's hitless upgrade, works by forwarding data plane traffic based on the last known state of the device's control plane as it appeared prior to the upgrade. All PoE (Power over Ethernet) devices connected to the switch will continue to receive power throughout the entirety of the upgrade. The below image depicts a comparison of what occurs during a normal software upgrade vs the Arista SSU hitless upgrade.   </p> Traditional Upgrade SSU Smart System Upgrade <p>The only observed packet loss, if any, occurs during the sub-second timeframe where the device's control plane comes back online, and re-syncs with the data plane.  </p> <p>SSU is the perfect solution for single-homed endpoints, which encompass the vast majority of campus end devices. These devices rely on a single connection to a switch for uptime, and with the introduction of SSU hitless upgrades, are now able to achieve continuous network uptime even during software upgrades. An access point, which can service hundreds of clients, can maintain power and internet connectivity while the access switch it's connected to undergoes a software upgrade. This is applicable to all access devices that service our network users.   </p> <p>As mentioned above, hitless upgrades can be executed entirely through CloudVision using the Software Management Studio. Simply assign a new version of EOS to your Arista switch and submit the workspace. You can directly download the desired EOS image without ever leaving CloudVision. Downloading the image will make it accessible in CloudVIsion for the current and all future devices to use.  </p> <p>After selecting the desired image and submitting the Workspace, within the Change Control tab, select the device, followed by the arguments tab, and under the \"Reload-Mode\" dropdown, select \"SSU Only\". This will instruct CloudVision to proceed with a hitless upgrade, as opposed to a standard software upgrade. The last step is the Approve and Execute the Change Control, and the device will begin the SSU process. You can view the logs associated with the change directly through the Change Control screen as well.   </p> SSU Smart System Upgrade <p>The Arista SSU Hitless upgrade is a game-changer for network engineers who once feared the task of completing  software upgrades.

Although the CLI is great at quickly gathering information, utilizing graphs and charts to visually represent that data allows for an illustrative way to measure network information. That\u2019s where the Dashboards tool in CloudVision is ready to help.  </p> <p>Dashboards give the ability for network data to be visually represented in graphs, charts, interactive menus, and customizable layouts. Rather than navigating across multiple devices, you can gather both summaries and in depth views of the entire network. CloudVision provinces pre-built Dashboards for you to view. However, in addition to that, you have the ability to become creative and customize these Dashboards to your liking. Let\u2019s take a look at some examples of Dashboards.  </p> Network Health Dashboard <p>In the example above, we have a dashboard that lists events that impact the health of the networks. The left hand horizontal bar chart works like this: the x-axis identifies a number of devices, the y-axis lists type of events that are harmful to given device, the colors of the bar categorize the event types as critical, error, or warning. By viewing this, we are informed that many devices in the network are exposed to potential harm. To further elaborate on those warning, take a look at the table located to the right.  </p> <p>The table on the right lists the events and the message associated with that event. By looking at these two side by side, we now know of potential issues that are impactful to the device. Had that not been there, we would not be able to identify issues early on before scaling out the production for future use. At the bottom of the dashboard, we see a timeline of critical issues for the untagged devices, further providing us with information necessary to fix.  </p> Device Power Consumption Dashboard <p>Another Dashboard that is pre-built into your CloudVision instance is the Device Power Consumption board. A method of analyzing devices for troubleshooting problems, could be to view this dashboard for an overall view of input and output wattage use. If you suspect that there are powers issues that are causing network disruptions, simply navigate to this page to see all the devices and their power consumption.  </p> <p>In addition to the graph, the bar at the top labeled \u201cdevices device*\u201d allows for you to view the metrics, specified for a particular device. In the case where you would prefer to view the power use of multiple devices, you can select those devices within the top drop down bar as well. The graphs readjust to the chosen device.
